Hi, I'm kikunot. I'm currently working on automating design processes and degital transformation in architecture industry. These are the Programming languages that I use: 

  1. Python(more than 3 yrs professional experience), 
  2. C#(more than 3 yrs professional experience), 
  3. some SQL (enough to generate, query and filter database)
  4. and some Matlab (enough to do prototyping tasks) 

I'm also looking for a mentor who has been succesful in this field.

Couple of project that I am currently working on:
- Mapping building classification code between UK, US and Japan (Uniclass, Omniclass and Japanese building standards)[Python]
- Extracting BIM model, sort the data as a SQL database[SQL]
- Design Automation[C#]

I'm interested in:
- SaaS for everyday consumers in architecture industries
- PaaS for BtoB in manufacturing industry
- Machine Learning for BtoC and BtoB
